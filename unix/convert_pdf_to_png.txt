That should be able to deal with just about anything you throw at it.

Tricks used:

find ... -print0 : causes find to print its results separated by the null character, let's us deal with newlines.
IFS= : this will disable word splitting, needed to deal with white space.
read -r: disables interpreting of backslash escape characters, to deal with files that contain backslashes.
read -d '': sets the record delimiter to the null character, to deal with find's output and correctly handle file names with newline characters.
${file%.*}.png : uses the shell's inbuilt string manipulation abilities to remove the extension
